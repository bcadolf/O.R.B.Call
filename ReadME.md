# Overview

This is a passion project I have always wanted to build a game. Currently this game is just in the start of version 1. Version 1 will have the game be mostly a text based UI game. A character in a fantasy world has just joined the fight against orbeasts creatures that are agaist mankind. Unlike most games instead of leveling and getting more stats like strength or health the character will collect items that are used to be stronger to fight deadlier orbeasts.

I used unity so that the game can grow as I become more familiar with the framework. After I get the logic and system down for the UI version I plan to make a 2d crawler and eventually build up to a 3d version.
